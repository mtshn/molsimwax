Assessing the accuracy of gas chromatographic retention index prediction using molecular similarity. The smax value is the similarity between the molecule for which the prediction is made and the closest molecule from the train set to it. This value can be used to give a rough estimate of how accurate a prediction can be. Details in the file molsimwax.ipynb
